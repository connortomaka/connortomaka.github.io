======
Computational microbial ecologist using ecological theory and experimental biochemistry to understand resource competition, trait-based modeling, and molecular-scale inter-species interactions in microbial communities. Currently based at the Environmental Genomics and Systems Biology Division and Joint Genome Institute at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. I also organize and moderate conferences on  applied math, computer science and philosophy of science. I publish writings and music in my spare time.
