Greetings!
======
I am a researcher and writer currently working in Exometbolomics at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. I also work in a leaf venation laboratory at UC Berkeley. I also co-organize a applied math and philosophy of science conference series with mathematician and graduate student Eric Schmid.  I like biking and music!
